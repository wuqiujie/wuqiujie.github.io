          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            To the Edge of the World is a short narrative experience set in
            CMU’s CAVE room. Guests stand on a motion platform surrounded
            by projections that simulate travelling at sea. They join a
            crew of three sailors on a quest to find the “edge of the
            world”, encountering monsters, storms and moments of doubt
            along the way.

          <h3>Theme & Setup</h3>
          <p>
            The assigned theme was to guide the guest through an
            interactive story using experimental platforms. We combined:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CAVE:</strong> a room-sized space with three
              projection walls and a motion platform on the floor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vive Trackers:</strong> used to track the boat’s
              movement and the guest’s position for camera control.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improv actors:</strong> performers in the room who
              interact with the guest and reinforce story beats.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section reveal">
          <h3>Role & Contributions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As <strong>producer</strong>, coordinated a two-week schedule
              and kept art, design and tech aligned.
            </li>
            <li>
              As <strong>programmer</strong>, implemented CAVE integration,
              tracker-based camera logic and interaction events.
            </li>
            <li>
              As <strong>technical artist</strong>, tuned lighting, water
              shaders and visual effects to support the narrative beats.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Experience Flow</h3>
          <p>
            The story begins with excitement as the sailors chase a mythic
            destination. As they repeatedly pass the same lighthouse,
            tension rises and one crew member begins to doubt the captain.
            The guest is placed right in the middle of this conflict,
            surrounded by waves, sounds and performers.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Building for a CAVE space pushed me to think beyond the headset
            and treat the entire room as a medium. I learned how important
            it is to coordinate timing between projections, physical
            motion, acting and sound design so the audience feels fully
            immersed.
